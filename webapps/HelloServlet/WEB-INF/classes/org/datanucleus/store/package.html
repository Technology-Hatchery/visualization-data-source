    Package handling the storage of classes to the datastore, and the management of the datastore.
    Each type of datastore will have its own subpackage (e.g org.datanucleus.store.rdbms) and its own StoreManager.
    When providing support for a new datastore you need to extend AbstractStoreManager.
    <p>
        The package also provides definition of StoreData - data held about each class and utilised by
        the StoreManager to perform its duties. This data is populated either at runtime when classes
        are requested, or when using an "auto-starter". There are several auto-start mechanisms. This
        package has ClassesAutoStarter and XMLAutoStarter.
