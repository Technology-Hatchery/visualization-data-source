        This package provides classes for the management of datastores that are "mapped". That is, 
        any datastore that needs information for classes/fields to be mapped into tables/columns. 
        This type of datastore would be something like RDBMS, which uses all of the concepts provided,
        or also Google BigTable that supports some ORM concepts.
