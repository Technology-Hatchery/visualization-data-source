<BODY>
    This package provides a series of expressions and literals used in the conversion of a JDOQL query into 
    the resultant SQL that is required to be executed in the datastore. The components are finely grained. 
    These expressions are used within, for example, a QueryStatement.
    <b>This package is DEPRECATED - to be replaced by org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.sql.*</b>
