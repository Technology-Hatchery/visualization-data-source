        Package providing the basis for backing stores for Collection/Map/array fields.
        Provide methods allowing addition/update/delete of elements in Collections/arrays
        and addition/update/delete of keys/values in Maps.
        Designed to be generic enough to work with any "mapped" datastore where a class maps to 
        a table and a field maps to a column (RDBMS-like), without actually including any
        RDBMS-specific assumptions.
