    Package providing the basis for evaluation of a string-based query.
    The JDOQLEvaluator/JPQLEvaluator provide in-memory evaluation of components of a string-based query.
    For example you can evaluate a collection of objects against just the filter, or just the range,
    or ordering etc, or any combination of the these. This provides flexibility where the datastore
    native query language only supports a subset of what JDOQL/JPQL require so the remainder can be
    applied in-memory.
