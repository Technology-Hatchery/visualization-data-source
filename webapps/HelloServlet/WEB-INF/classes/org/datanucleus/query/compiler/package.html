    Package handling the compilation of queries.
    Provides compilation of "string-based" queries. Provides handling for different query languages
    such as JDOQL, JPQL and SQL(simplified).
    Compilation of a string-based query goes through two steps.
    <ol>
        <li>Parse of the string converting each component of the query into a Node tree</li>
        <li>Compilation of the Node tree into an expression tree</li>
    </ol>
    From this tree the evaluation process can be configured to convert it into the native query
    language for the datastore; this part is handled within each datastore plugin.
    From this tree an in-memory evaluation can be performed. This is provided in the
    <i>org.datanucleus.query.evaluator</i> package and subpackage(s).
