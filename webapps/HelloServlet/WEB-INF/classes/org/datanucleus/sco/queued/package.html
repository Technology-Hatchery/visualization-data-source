        This package provides classes allowing SCO containers to queue mutating commands (add, remove, 
        clear etc). When a SCO is operating in "queued" mode it saves the operation for processing at 
        some later point. This is to cater for optimistic transactions where we want to delay all datastore 
        updates until the commit stage and do it later.

        All operations implement QueuedOperation and have a perform() method to actually perform the 
        operation on the backing store it was required for.
