<BODY>
    Provides implementations of the "simple" wrappers for the mutable Second Class Objects (SCO's) 
    supported by DataNucleus. Please refer to section 6.3 of the JDO 1.0 spec.
    This "simple" form of the SCO wrapper has a delegate and intercepts any mutating methods, marking the 
    field as dirty. There is no "backing store" or lazy loading like in the "backed" wrapper.
