<p>Notes on the FMG. This program was originally written in Apple Basic and I
    found it in Creative Computing in (I think) the early 1980's. I do not remember
    the author or have a reference. I've contacted David Ahl (the publisher of Creative
    Computing) to get a reference, but even he failed. The game uses a simple trick
    of remembering all previous moves in all previous games and weighting these
    up or down when it wins or loses. It can do this since there are so few possibilities
    for moves in a game. This is but one way of simulating intelligence: have a
    really good memory. </p>
